This Program is a payroll management system.


Order of operations:
- First you will need to create an account.
- Login to your account.

- Select an option.
    1. Input hours/Jobs for an employee
    2. Add Employee
    3. Remove Employee
    4. List Employees
    5. Edit Employee information
    6. Calculate pay for one employee
    7. Calculate pay for all
    8. Logout

- You can add, remove, edit and list employees. 
- You can input hours and jobs for Hourly and commission employees.
- You can Calculate the pay for 1 or all employees.

- Some options are reliant on other which but it flows pretty obviously.

There is some Legacy code leftover from when I was a little more ambitious. I wanted to have employee accounts that could view/add their own pay/hours/jobs.
I left it in because I think I will come back to this project.
